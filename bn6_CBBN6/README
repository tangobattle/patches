The point of this patch was to make a fun flexible PVP patch which allows weaker chips feel more viable to use and allow more freedom of use of lower ranked chips within folders.
Already strong chips are mostly untouched. This description seems familiar. Also check out the LDR Patch! it's pretty cool and fun and cool.

You can use your normal BN6 save files but make sure these chips are not in your folder when you load up the game
