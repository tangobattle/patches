The Star Force Battle Music patch replaces the battle music in Battle Network 6 with music backported from the Mega Man Star Force series. Currently only "Radio Virus Busting" (SF3 virus battle music) is supported, however more songs may be included in the future.

This patch has been compiled alongside BingusBN6 and is cross-compatible with normal Bingus, refer to BingusBN6's README for information on what is changed from original BN6.
