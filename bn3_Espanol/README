This is a nearly 100% complete translation of Megaman Battle Network 3 to Spanish,
only some names and words have been left in english, most menus, the story and 
chip descriptions have been translated. 
This was translated by the group called MNTWFL TRANSLATIONS.
This patch has the added bonus of having the chip BassGS and Punk which you get
by the navi in the tutorial. It also has the exclusive chips of BowlMan from the Blue
version as well as the Net Battle only reward chip Balance.
It also has the exclusive chips of MistMan from the White version as well as the Net
Battle only reward Chip DeltaRay. These chips are given
by Chaud near the final scene.
