Listen up, MMBN3 White RE--mod is the best damn experience that will ever grace your miserable existence on this corporeal realm and whatever might come next. This Electronic God that your limited mind can only see as a game will pull back the curtain and force you, willing or not, to know the answers to questions that would immediately send you into comatose if you even came close to thinking of them yourself, such as "how would the neutral game change if you could permanently freeze the custom gauge" and "what if FolderBack was a 30MB Standard chip". You may think you know where this is going, but you don't. The All Knowing Deity contained within these bytes knows what happens when we die, and it knows what will happen to you when you die, but it will not tell you. Instead you are going to receive MasterStyle in * code. Yeah it's a standalone chip now. Get ready to mash A like your life depends on it, because it does. It matters more now than it ever did. If you feel a general sense of safety and comfort in your day to day life and you want to keep it, then turn back now and fall to your knees before the vice that you think will help you forget what you've seen today.
