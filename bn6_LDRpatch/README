The point of this patch was to make a fun flexible PVP patch which allows weaker chips feel more viable to use and allow more freedom of use of lower ranked chips within folders.
Already strong chips are mostly untouched. My own personal flair took over after many patches. But looking to tune tools as time goes on!

Check out the details and changes of the patch using the link above. Will Recommend looking at the LDR Patch Library!

Please use the save included as i've changed most chip codes can cause crashes if you dont use this save file. If you dont have them they are available
on my google drive from the link above or at:

feel free to message/dm me on discord (ldr100) feedback in regards to the patch. I'm always open to hear opinions on how I can make it more fun for all players.
