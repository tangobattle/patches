The Bingus Patch for Battle Network 6 fixes glitches that negatively affect pvp, as well as niche imbalances caused by chips that behave differently depending on whether they were used by the Host or Client. This patch aims to improve the competitive integrity of pvp in the rollback era. Modifications are minimal and only target longstanding issues. All changes are vetted and approved by the community. 

Fixed a bug in which every hitbox that collided with a target on the same frame would completely overwrite the decross flag, which would cause only the last hitbox to be processed on a frame to decide whether a player got decrossed. Now multiple hits on the same frame will not prevent decrossing from happening.

When Windrack is used point-blank against someone who is protected by a barrier, the gusts from the windrack will always have a chance to move the player. This is accomplished by having the wind gust linger at its original position for 2 frames when it's first spawned. This change also applies to visible wind gusts such as those spawned by the chips Fan/Wind or TenguCross, so they will stay put for 2 frames before moving when they're spawned.

When Thunder or BugDeathThunder is on the same panel as the character that it's targeting, it will no longer move in the same hardcoded direction irrespective of which side spawned it. Instead it will now move in the direction regarded as "forward" by the player who spawned the thunder. 

The screen transition when starting a netbattle has been changed from a white screen to a black screen. This is a minor QoL change for those with sensitive eyes. The change has no effect on gameplay.
