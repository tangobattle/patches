This is a nearly 100% complete translation of Mega Man Battle Network to Spanish. Only some names and words have been left in English, most menus, the story and chip descriptions have been translated. This was translated by the group called MNTWFL TRANSLATIONS, this game has the added bonus of having the chip of Bass which you can get just by reading the first email sent by Lanâ€™s dad.
