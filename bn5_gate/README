This patch allows navis other than MegaMan to be used in link play. Note that you must use a save that already has a different navi set.

Offsets of interest:

MEGAMAN5_TP_BRBE_00:

0x0800549a -> c0 46         # Allows START menu to open
0x08135936 -> c0 46 c0 46   # Removes Navi reset

MEGAMAN5_TC_BRKE_00:

0x0800549a -> c0 46         # Allows START menu to open
0x08135a1e -> c0 46 c0 46   # Removes Navi reset
